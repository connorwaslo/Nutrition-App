# Here's the flow of data

### Mobile App
1. User takes photo of food
2. Google Cloud does magic image recognition for us
3. App stores image and food data into Firebase (database) to be used by web app

### Web App
1. User logs in with Wix
2. Loads data for user: amount of each macro (calories, carbs, fat, and protein) consumed since using the app
3. Personalized profile for each user: outlines goals, goal date, motivation, and recommendation on how to reach goal (based on diet patterns) as well as progress chart
